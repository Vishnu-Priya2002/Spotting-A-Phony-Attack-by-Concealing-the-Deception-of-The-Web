Built a centralized fraud detection platform using machine learning to identify fraudulent reviews, goods, payments, and URLs


In the current digital environment, phishing assaults pose a serious risk since malevolent actors are always coming up with new strategies to trick people. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are examples of cutting-edge technology that can be used to identify fake URLs and evaluate web content in order to combat this. Sentiment analysis tools are useful for detecting fraudulent reviews and unethical behavior. Blockchain technology can be used to confirm the legitimacy of products and stop the sale of fake items. The fraud payment can be predicted using logistic regression and random forest. Smooth front-end and back-end system integration facilitates real-time monitoring and analysis, allowing for prompt detection and handling of fraudulent assaults within a single web page. We can more effectively identify and counteract false assaults by leveraging cutting-edge technology, blockchain, and sentiment analysis on the internet, eventually safeguarding users and promoting a safer digital ecosystem.
